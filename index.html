        - The browser will ignore the empty spaces between words if you write direct inside body element without using the html elements
        - if the element has too much attributes you can orgnize it and put each attribute in line and next line write the next attribute
        - you can write the value of attrbiutes between single qoute '' or double qoute "" , it's the same thing.

        Formating through HTML without using CSS:
        <b> </b> => Bold to make words Bold type inside paragraph
        <strong> </strong> => same Bold but the difference (the strong is Important text not only Bold text)

        <i> </i> => Italic style font
        <em> </em> => same Italic style font but the difference (em is Important text not only italic style)

        <mark> </mark> => make highlight on words inside the text or paragraph

        <u> </u> => underline words to make underline words

        <small> </small> =>smaller text-words if you want to make some words inside paragraph a littel bit small than other wirds inside text

        <del> </del> => to delete some words or parts of my paragraph it will make a line on this text to show to user that it is deleted
        <s>   </s>  => it means that the text between is no longer accurate or no longer relevant and it works same <del> </del> 
        <ins> </ins> => Inserted text it will put underline to show that this text or words inside the paragraph was added new to it

        <sub> </sub> => H<sub>2</sub>O      // H2O  but the 2 go small and down
